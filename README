********** IMPORTANT NOTES *************
# To verilate the core use command : make rand_inst
# Before running any simulation run the command : make clean in order to clean previous logs.
# Manually delete mutated_initial_val.hex file by using command line command : rm mutated_initial_val.hex
# To verify the intructions mutation on 2 simulations follow below steps :
1. make clean
2. rm mutated_initial_val.hex
   (Above steps necessary if have previous simulation in the repo)
3. make rand_inst
4. make clean
5. open hdl/picorv32/memory_modelling.sv and comment out line no. 46 & uncomment line no. 45
6. open hdl/picorv32/picorv32core.v and comment out line no. 63 and 64 & uncomment line no. 61 and 62
7. make rand_inst
8. gvimdiff mutated_initial_val.hex mutated_initial_val_check.hex (both the files should be identical)
